            <h2 class="mb-xl">General Questions</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">What is mental skills coaching?</h4>
                <p>Mental skills coaching is the systematic development of psychological capabilities that enhance performance. Unlike traditional sports psychology that often focuses on addressing problems, mental skills coaching proactively builds mental strength, focus, resilience, and other capabilities that help you perform at your best when it matters most.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">How is this different from sports psychology?</h4>
                <p>Traditional sports psychology often takes a reactive, clinical approach—addressing mental health issues or problems when they arise. Our approach is developmental and proactive. We don't just fix problems; we build comprehensive mental capabilities across five dimensions: strength, conditioning, technique, tactics, and strategy. We work as coaching partners focused on performance optimization, not as clinicians focused on pathology.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">Who do you work with?</h4>
                <p>We work with elite athletes (professional, Olympic, national level), sports teams (professional clubs, national teams, high-performance programs), coaches and support staff, and heads of high-performance programs. Our clients span rugby, motorsport, combat sports, netball, and many other sports.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">Do you work with amateur or recreational athletes?</h4>
                <p>Our focus is on elite and high-performance sport where the mental demands are greatest. However, we do work with serious athletes who are committed to reaching the highest levels, even if they're not there yet. The key is commitment and the drive to develop.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Working Together -->
            <h2 class="mb-xl mt-3xl">Working Together</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">How long does a typical coaching engagement last?</h4>
                <p>It varies based on your goals and needs. Some athletes work with us for specific competition preparation (8-12 weeks), while others engage in ongoing development throughout a season or multiple seasons. Team programs might run for a pre-season block or be embedded throughout the year. We'll discuss the right approach for your situation during our consultation.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">How often do sessions occur?</h4>
                <p>For individual athletes, sessions are typically weekly or fortnightly, with additional touchpoints around competitions. For teams, we might work with the group weekly while also providing individual sessions with key players or leaders. For head coaches, we typically meet fortnightly with real-time support available as needed.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">Do you work with athletes outside Australia?</h4>
                <p>Yes. While Jay is based in Sydney, we work with athletes and teams globally through virtual sessions. For major competitions, training camps, and intensive team programs, in-person work can be arranged regardless of location.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">What happens in a typical session?</h4>
                <p>Sessions are tailored to your current needs and development plan. We might work on specific mental skills (visualization, self-talk, routines), debrief recent performances, prepare for upcoming competitions, or work through challenges you're facing. It's practical, focused, and always connected to your real-world performance.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">Is everything confidential?</h4>
                <p>Absolutely. Confidentiality is fundamental to effective coaching. What we discuss stays between us. For team engagements, we maintain appropriate boundaries between individual and team work. This creates the psychological safety needed for honest, productive development.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- The Approach -->
            <h2 class="mb-xl mt-3xl">The Approach</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">What is the Integral+ model?</h4>
                <p>The Integral+ High-Performance Model is our comprehensive framework for mental performance development. It addresses five dimensions that parallel physical training: Mental Strength (resilience), Mental Conditioning (endurance), Mental Technique (skills like visualization), Mental Tactics (in-game decision-making), and Mental Strategy (long-term development). This ensures complete mental preparation, not just isolated skills.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">What methodologies do you use?</h4>
                <p>The Integral+ model draws on NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming), Integral Psychology, cognitive sciences, and developmental coaching principles. These are combined into a practical, performance-focused approach refined over 20+ years of elite coaching experience.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">How do you measure progress?</h4>
                <p>We track progress through multiple lenses: self-assessment across mental dimensions, performance outcomes, feedback from coaches and teammates (where appropriate), and qualitative reflection on growth. The goal isn't just to feel better—it's to perform better when it counts.</p>

            <!-- Getting Started -->
            <h2 class="mb-xl mt-3xl">Getting Started</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">How do I get started?</h4>
                <p>Simply fill out the contact form or email us directly. We'll schedule a discovery call to understand your situation, goals, and challenges. From there, we'll discuss whether we're a good fit and, if so, propose a tailored approach for your development.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">What does the initial consultation involve?</h4>
                <p>The initial consultation is a 30-minute conversation where we get to know each other. We'll explore your current situation, what you're trying to achieve, and any specific challenges you're facing. You'll also get a sense of how we work and whether the approach resonates with you.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200); padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">What does it cost?</h4>
                <p>Investment varies based on the type of engagement, duration, and specific requirements. We provide customized proposals after understanding your needs during the initial consultation. Our work represents a significant investment in elite performance development.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item" style="padding: var(--space-lg) 0;">
                <h4 class="text-navy mb-sm">I'm not sure if this is right for me. Should I still reach out?</h4>
                <p>Absolutely. The initial consultation is designed to help both of us determine fit. There's no pressure and no obligation. If mental performance is something you're curious about developing, it's worth having the conversation.</p>
